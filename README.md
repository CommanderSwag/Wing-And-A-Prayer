# Wing-And-A-Prayer
This project solves the Wing And A Prayer airlines problem.

The idea behind this problem is to construct an efficient system of
ensuring flights do not get overbooked. The methods in the program
allow for the addition and removal of passengers such that the 
current status of how many and which open seats are available
is known at all times. 

Airlines use a very similar program in real life.
